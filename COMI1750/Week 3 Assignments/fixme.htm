	<h1>What is <em>Markup Validation</em>?</h1>
	
    <p>Most pages on the World Wide Web are written in computer languages
	(such as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>)
	that allow Web authors to structure text, add multimedia content, and
	specify what appearance, or style, the result should have.
	</p>

    <p>As for every language, these have their own <em>grammar</em>, <em>vocabulary</em>
	and <em>syntax</em>, and every document written with these computer languages
	are supposed to follow these rules. The (X)HTML languages, for all versions up 
	to XHTML 1.1, are using machine-readable grammars called 
    <abbr title="Document Type Definition">DTD</abbr>s, a mechanism inherited from
	<!-- closed the open formatting bracket for "<abbr>"-->
	<a href="sgml.html"><abbr> ="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr></a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	However, Just as texts in a natural language
	can include spelling or grammar errors, documents using Markup languages
	may (for various reasons) not be following these rules.
    The process of verifying whether a document actually follows the rules for the
	language(s) it uses is called <em>validation</em>, and the tool used for that
	is a validator. A document that passes this process with success is called 
	<em>valid</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>With these concepts in mind, we can define "markup validation" as the process of 
    checking a Web document against the grammar (generally a DTD) it claims to be using.
	</p>

    <h2>Is validation some kind of quality control? 
	Does "valid" mean "quality approved by W3C"?</h2>

    <p>Validity is one of the quality criteria for a Web page, but there are
	many others. In other words, a <em>valid</em> Web page is not necessarily
	a good web page, but an <em>invalid</em> Web page has little chance
	of being a good web page</p>

    <p>For that reason, the fact that the W3C Markup Validator says that
	one page passes validation does <strong>not</strong> mean that
	W3C assesses that it is a good page. It only means that a tool (not 
	necessarily without flaws) has found the page to comply with a specific
	set of rules. No more, no less. This is also why the "valid ..." icons 
	should never be considered as a "W3C seal of quality".
