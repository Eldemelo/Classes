            <i>Why am I taking this course?</i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am taking this course because Web development is a vital skill to have in the software development and software engineering world. It's a front-end developer skill, but will help me build up my skillset for an overall full-stack developer

<!-- 
    1: The b element did not work the same in all the places it was used. In the title, it did not change the text, but in the header it did
    
    2: The i element worked as expected in the body section
    
    3: The header likely takes formatting from the browser rather than the HTML code-->
